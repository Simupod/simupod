"""Mode tracking — a consistent labeling of FDE modes across a sequence of planes.

A finite-difference mode solver returns the modes of each cross-section sorted by
descending ``n_eff``. That order is **not** a stable identity: as a geometry (or
wavelength, or bend radius) is swept, two modes can swap ``n_eff`` ordering at a
**crossing**, so "mode 0" silently changes which physical mode it is. Reporting a
mode's ``n_eff(z)`` curve, a per-mode S-matrix, or interpolating modes between
sampled planes (the CVCS efficiency trick) all require following each *physical*
mode through the sweep regardless of the solver's per-plane ordering.

Mode tracking establishes that correspondence by **field overlap**: between
adjacent planes, each mode is matched to the most-similar mode on the previous
plane (a global assignment, not greedy), giving a set of continuous "tracks". It
also fixes the arbitrary per-solve eigenvector sign/phase so that consecutive
modes along a track are phase-aligned — required for any interpolation between
planes.

This is the prerequisite for CVCS (continuously-varying-cross-section) modelling
and for the per-mode interpretation of an EME (:mod:`photonhub.plugins.eme`)
cascade. It is deliberately general: the planes can be the z-sections of an EME
device, or the same cross-section re-solved across a wavelength band or a bend
radius — anything that yields a sequence of mode sets **on a common transverse
grid**.

Similarity metric
=================
Modes are compared by the normalized Hermitian transverse-E correlation

    O[i, j] = <E_i, E_j> / (|E_i| |E_j|),
    <E_i, E_j> = integral (Ex_i* Ex_j + Ey_i* Ey_j) dA,   |O[i, j]| in [0, 1] ,

which is 1 for an identical field shape and ~0 for an orthogonal one (a pure
shape correlation, independent of the EME power inner product, hence robust at
any resolution). The complex phase of ``O`` gives the relative sign/phase used to
align modes along a track. The assignment maximizing the total ``|O|`` between two
planes is found with the Hungarian algorithm
(:func:`scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment`).

Limitation: an *exact* crossing (degenerate modes) is genuinely ambiguous — the
two modes are an arbitrary delocalized mix there. Sample finely enough that
adjacent planes stay clearly distinguishable and avoid landing a plane on the
degeneracy.
