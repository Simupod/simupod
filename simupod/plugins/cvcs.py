"""CVCS — continuously-varying-cross-section EME via mode interpolation.

A naive EME staircases a z-varying device into ``N`` constant-cross-section
sections and solves the FDE modes of *every* one — ``N`` eigensolves, the
dominant cost. CVCS exploits the fact that, in a **smoothly varying** (adiabatic)
region, the modes evolve smoothly with z: solve the modes at only a few **key
planes** and **interpolate** them onto a fine sub-slicing, so the dense cascade
costs ``K`` eigensolves (``K << N``) plus cheap array interpolation.

This is the efficiency capstone on top of :mod:`simupod.plugins.eme` and
:mod:`simupod.plugins.mode_tracking`. Tracking is the prerequisite: to
interpolate "the same" mode between two key planes, the modes must first be put
in correspondence (and sign/phase aligned) — :func:`interpolate_mode` aligns the
pair it is given, and :func:`cvcs_sections` tracks + reorders the key planes into
a consistent basis before interpolating each track.

Method
======
Between two key planes A, B (tracked so index ``m`` is the same physical mode),
the mode at fractional position ``s in [0, 1]`` is the renormalized linear blend

    e_m(s) = normalize[ (1-s) e_m^A + s * align * e_m^B ] ,   n_eff_m(s) = (1-s) n_eff_m^A + s n_eff_m^B

(and likewise for ``h``), where ``align`` is the unit phase that makes A and B
co-phased (from their transverse-E overlap). The interpolated planes feed
:func:`simupod.plugins.eme.run_eme` exactly like solved ones — the EME interface
re-orthonormalizes each basis, so the blend only needs to be *approximately* right.

Conversion (the fixed multimode basis)
======================================
CVCS **does** capture inter-mode conversion, *provided the whole modal basis is
carried through* — :func:`cvcs_sections` matches the key planes with a full
permutation and never drops a mode, so a mode the fundamental converts into stays
in the basis even if it is near-cutoff at the narrow planes and only well-confined
at the wide ones. With that fixed basis, interpolating between key planes and
cascading reproduces a full multimode staircase (e.g. a symmetric taper's
TE0->TE2 conversion) at ``K << N`` solves. (The conversion was never an
interpolation problem — an earlier version *dropped* the conversion target by
keeping only globally-present "tracks", which made it return the adiabatic limit.)

Validity / scope
================
Interpolation reproduces the true modes to ``O((key spacing)^2)``, so accuracy is
set by the **key-plane density relative to how fast the modes evolve**: a smoothly
varying cross-section needs few key planes; a region where the modes change quickly
needs more. The hard case is a **sharp avoided crossing** (near-degenerate modes
swapping over a tiny z-window): interpolation cannot resolve the rapid mode
variation there, so it needs near-staircase key-plane density — at which point the
plain :mod:`~simupod.plugins.eme` staircase is the simpler tool. CVCS's ``N/K``
eigensolve saving is realized wherever the modes are smooth (the common case);

    The key planes are put in correspondence with a *full permutation* match (every

    that the fundamental converts into (even one that is near-cutoff / "born" only

    what lets CVCS reproduce a multimode staircase (e.g. a symmetric taper's
    TE0->TE2 conversion) at ``K << N`` solves, not just the adiabatic limit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    key_planes:
        ``K`` mode lists (``K >= 2``), the FDE modes solved at the key
        cross-sections, all on the **same transverse grid** and with the **same
        number of modes** (solve a ``num_modes`` every key plane supports).
    key_z_um:
        The ``K`` monotonically increasing z-positions (microns) of the key
        planes. The device spans ``[key_z_um[0], key_z_um[-1]]``.
    n_subslices:
        Number of interpolated, uniformly spaced propagation slices spanning the
        device. Choose ``n_subslices >> K`` (the point of CVCS).
    min_confidence:
        Optional guard (default ``0.0`` = off): if ``> 0``, reject when any
        adjacent key-plane match is weaker than this overlap — a coarse check that
        the key planes are dense enough to correspond. It is conservative (a
        near-cutoff *higher* mode can have a weak link without spoiling the
        result), so the real validation is convergence in the number of key
        planes; leave it off unless you want a hard floor.

    Returns
    -------
