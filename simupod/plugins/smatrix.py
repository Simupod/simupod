"""Multiport scattering-matrix (S-matrix) assembler — pure Python, no engine.

This is the PhotonHub analogue of Tidy3D's ``ComponentModeler`` / Lumerical's
S-parameter sweep, built entirely on top of the mode-resolved **complex** modal
amplitude that :func:`simupod.plugins.mode_overlap.mode_amplitude` extracts
from a recorded DFT plane. Where :mod:`mode_devices` gives you single-mode power
``T(f) = |c|^2`` per monitor, this module keeps the *phase* of ``c`` and arranges
the per-port amplitudes into a proper scattering matrix.

S-parameter definition
=======================
For an N-port device, mode the field on each port plane as a sum of an inward
(toward the device) and an outward (away from the device) guided wave. The
S-matrix relates the outgoing modal amplitudes ``b`` to the incoming ones ``a``:

    b = S a ,    S_ij(f) = b_i(f) / a_j(f)   with port j the only one driven.

``a_j`` is the amplitude **incident** on the device at the driven port; ``b_i``
is the amplitude **scattered out** of the device at port i. Each is the complex
normalized modal coefficient ``c = a_pm / P_mode`` of
:func:`~simupod.plugins.mode_overlap.mode_amplitude` — so

* ``|c|^2`` is the power carried by that mode (the same number
  :func:`~simupod.plugins.mode_devices.ModeMonitor.mode_power` /
  ``mode_transmission`` report), hence ``|S_ij|^2`` is a power transmission /
  reflection and a lossless reciprocal device has ``S† S = I``;
* the phase of ``c`` advances by ``e^{-i beta L}`` along a straight guide, so
  ``S`` carries the physical propagation phase.

Incident vs scattered: the directional projection
==================================================
Each :class:`SPort` carries the **outgoing direction** — the sign along the
monitor's propagation ``axis`` that points *out of* the device through that port
(``"+"`` or ``"-"``). The two directional projections of the recorded plane are
then:

* outgoing / scattered ``b_i`` = project onto the mode travelling in the port's
  outgoing direction;
* incoming / incident ``a_i`` = project onto the mode travelling the *opposite*
  way (into the device).

At the **driven** port the recorded plane (placed on the total-field side, just
inside the source) carries incident + reflected: its incoming projection is the
incident ``a_j`` and its outgoing projection is the reflected ``b_j`` (so
``S_jj`` is the port reflection). At every **other** port only scattered light
leaves, so the outgoing projection is the transmitted ``b_i`` and ``S_ij`` is the
port-i transmission. This directional split is exactly what the forward/backward
overlap of :func:`mode_amplitude` provides.

Normalization
=============
``a`` and ``b`` are the **source-spectrum-normalized** complex modal amplitudes
already living in the run data: the recorded phasors are divided by ``A0*S(f)``
(NUMERICS.md section 12), so that normalization cancels in the ratio
``S_ij = b_i / a_j`` and leaves a dimensionless scattering parameter. The
per-port ``P_mode`` normalization inside ``mode_amplitude`` makes ``|S_ij|^2`` a
power ratio (a clean straight through-guide reads ``|S21| ≈ 1``). No de-embedding
of the source-to-monitor or monitor-to-port reference plane is applied — ``S``
is referenced to the monitor planes as placed (see "What's not handled").

Output
======
:func:`smatrix` returns **one column** of S (the column for the driven port) as
``{(port_out, port_in): {freq_hz: S}}`` — i.e. ``S_ij`` for every port ``i`` with
``j`` fixed to the driven port. Run it once per driven port and feed the columns
to :func:`assemble_smatrix` to get the full matrix as an :class:`xarray.DataArray`
indexed ``(port_out, port_in, f)``. :func:`reciprocity_error` /
:func:`passivity_violation` (and their ``assert_*`` / ``is_*`` wrappers) check the
assembled matrix.

What's not handled (deferred)
=============================
* **Multimode ports.** One mode per port (the monitor's ``mode``). A multimode
  S-matrix would index ports by (port, mode_index); the per-mode amplitudes are
  available by re-projecting onto each mode, but the bookkeeping here is
  single-mode.
* **De-embedding.** S is referenced to the monitor planes; no phase de-embedding
  back to a common reference plane is performed (do it externally by multiplying
  by ``e^{i beta L}`` per port if needed).
* **Source-overlap correction at the driven port.** The incident ``a_j`` is read
  from the recorded total field's incoming projection, which assumes the launched
  mode matches the monitor's ``mode``; a mode-mismatched launch would bias
  ``a_j``.
