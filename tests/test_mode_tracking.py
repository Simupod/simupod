"""Mode tracking (``simupod.plugins.mode_tracking``) — overlap matching and
crossing-aware labeling.

The load-bearing test is a controllable **n_eff crossing**: two weakly-coupled
cores whose widths are swept in opposite directions. Their localized modes swap
n_eff ordering at the crossing, so the solver's "mode 0" jumps from one core to
the other — but overlap tracking follows each physical mode continuously (each
stays localized on its own core, with a smooth monotonic n_eff curve). A taper
(no crossing) must track to the identity, confirming tracking does not disturb
the easy case.
